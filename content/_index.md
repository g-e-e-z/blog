# Engineering Agoge

Welcome to my ramblings. Iâ€™m Alex, a Software Engineer living in Colorado. I am a neovim and command line fanatic aspiring to become more insufferable.

I'm starting this website as I begin learning and reviewing technical topics to understand how we make rocks think for us. This will be a place for me to summarize and archive my learnings.
